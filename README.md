## GolosData
The goal of the GolosData project is to make data from the
GOLOS blockchain more accessible to developers, researchers and 3rd party services.

GolosData is currently powered by MongoDB, the most used nosql, and [5th](http://db-engines.com/en/ranking) most popular database solution in the world.
MongoDB comes with a powerful query language, and it allows us to easily accommodate blockchain changes thanks to schema flexibility.

With GolosData, you can query for any kind of information living on the GOLOS blockchain, such as Accounts, Posts, Transactions, Blocks or any kind of Operations.


### Getting Started
I highly recommend [RoboMongo](https://robomongo.org/) as a GUI utility for exploring GolosData.
